    description: "The Toyota iQ represented a groundbreaking approach to city car design, offering exceptional space efficiency in an ultra-compact package. Measuring just 2.98 meters in length—shorter than most microcars—the iQ nevertheless provided seating for up to four passengers through innovative packaging, including an asymmetric dashboard design, ultra-thin seatbacks, and a compact differential that allowed the front wheels to be pushed to the extreme corners of the vehicle. The exterior featured distinctive, chunky styling with minimal overhangs, a wide stance, and high beltline creating a substantial appearance despite its tiny footprint. Power came from small displacement engines including 1.0-liter and 1.33-liter gasoline units in most markets, paired with either manual or continuously variable transmissions driving the front wheels. The interior emphasized quality over typical city car expectations, with premium materials and available features including leather upholstery, navigation, and automatic climate control—unusual amenities in this segment. Safety was a priority with up to nine airbags including the world's first rear window curtain airbag, helping the iQ achieve a five-star Euro NCAP rating despite its diminutive size. The innovative '3+1' seating arrangement allowed three adults and one child (or small adult) to fit within the minimal footprint, though the space behind the driver was suitable only for small children or cargo. While never achieving the same iconic status as competitors like the Smart Fortwo, the iQ earned recognition for its clever design, premium approach to the city car segment, and sophisticated engineering solutions to maximize interior space. The model also served as the basis for the Aston Martin Cygnet, a luxury city car created to help the British sports car manufacturer meet European fleet emissions requirements."
